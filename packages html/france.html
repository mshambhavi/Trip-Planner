    <p><h3>Day 3 : Bordeaux</h3></p><p>Bordeaux is one of the most beautiful places to visit in south of France. We would have advised a south of France road trip, but the driving will take up a lot of time off your 7 days. Hence the quick 1-hour flight. Extraordinary at best and gorgeous at worst, the best time to visit Bordeaux is all year long! Some of the top tourist attractions that you should explore while in Bordeaux include the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Cathedral of Saint Andrew, the monumental Grand Théâtre, the photogenic Place de la Bourse and the medieval Grosse Cloche (Big Clock). If you want to go on a wine tour in France, know that the red wine Bordeaux comes from this very region and is named after this city.  </p>
    <p><h3>Day 4 : Avignon</h3></p><p>This delightful little commune of France is home to the magnificent Palais des Papes- a 14th century palace of the pope, and you should definitely visit it while in town. Full of history, theatre and joy, things to do in Avignon are aplenty. Your entire day will be spent exploring the museum of Petit Palais, walking across the iconic Saint Bénézet Bridge, visiting the Cathedral of Notre-Dame des Doms and munching on delectable food at the Place de l'Horloge which is the main square in Avignon.</p>
    <p><h3>Day 5 : Marseille</h3></p><p>Founded 2,600 years ago, Marseille is the oldest city in the country and exploring it will be the best way to spend 7 days in France. Boasting of approximately 300 days of sunshine, this city proves that any time is the best time to visit France! Marseille must see attractions include the Old port area, the Basilique Notre-Dame de la Garde, the colourful neighbourhood of Le Panier, the Museum of European and Mediterranean Civilisations and the island prison of Château d’If. </p>
    <p><h3>Day 6 : Arrival in Nice</h3></p><p>Nice is a superb seaside city in France. Located at the foot of the Alps and having the Mediterranean Sea at the coast, Nice attracts thousands of tourists every year. On day six, you should explore the tourist attractions that the city has to offer. The Promenade des Anglais, the Castle Hill Park, the Musée Matisse, the Monastère Notre-Dame-de-Cimiez and the Russian orthodox cathedral of Cathédrale Orthodoxe Russe St-Nicolas are places that you should definitely check out.  </p>
    <p><h3>Day 7 : Nice tour</h3></p><p>This day should be full of Nice experiences. From taking a walk down the rustic Vieille Ville (Old Town) area to exploring the Museum Of Modern And Contemporary Art, from indulging in a delicious plate of Ratatouille to shopping at the Cours Saleya Market, your last day of 7 days in France should leave you with beautiful memories that you can cherish for a lifetime. </p>
