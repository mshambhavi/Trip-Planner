    <p>Japan is more popular than ever – and for good reason, the country is teeming with gorgeous scenery, delicious food, and ancient culture. Going to Japan will leave you speechless and overload your senses, but in the best way possible. A week in Japan is usually classified as a quick trip, but it is the perfect amount of time to see everything from bustling cities to tranquil shrines. Japan is also a very appreciative and cultured country. Japan has a large, state-of-the-art library in virtually every major city. The Japanese, who place high value on education, attend one of over 60 national universities or the countless other private institutions there.</p>
    <p>The Japanese also are lovers of all types of sports. Baseball, soccer, volleyball, tennis, and skiing are all secular favorites. Japan is a wondrous country filled with a rich cultural heritage and many customs that are different from those in the western world. Japan is a country in East Asia. It is a group of many islands close to the east coast of Korea, China and Russia.  </p>
    <h2>ITINERARY : </h2>
    <p><h3>Day 1 : Western Tokyo</h3></p><p>Our first day in Western Tokyo will tour the familiar side of the city: Shinjuku, Shibuya, Harajuku, and Roppongi. These are Tokyo’s biggest neighborhood names, which contain the city’s most recognizable sights and architecture. </p>
    <p><h3>Day 2 : Eastern Tokyo</h3></p><p>For your second day, it’s on to Tokyo’s “low city,” which is also the city’s eastern side. This area is on the delta of the Sumida River and it’s what remains of the historic Tokyo, or old Edo. </p>
    <p><h3>Day 3 : Tokyo DisneySea</h3></p><p>Full disclosure: we are huge Disney and theme park fans, and spend a lot of time here. With that said, we also think Tokyo DisneySea is a compelling option for anyone who is visiting Japan, not just obsessives like us. This is the most lavishly-themed park in the world, and nothing like the familiar castle parks you’ll find at Disneyland or Walt Disney World.  </p>
    <p><h3>Day 4 : Shinkansen to Kyoto</h3></p><p>Taking the Shinkansen (colloquially known as the bullet train) is a quintessential experience when visiting Japan, and it’s also extremely painless.</p>
    <p><h3>Day 5 : Eastern Kyoto</h3></p><p>This is essentially just a straight-line path along the foothills of Kyoto’s Higashiyama Mountains from the popular Kiyomizudera Temple in the south to the iconic Silver Pavilion in the north.In between, you’ll cover a ton of ground, seeing the historic Higashiyama District without crowds, before visiting the underrated Kenninji Temple, strolling the Path of Philosophers, wandering the idyllic Honenin Temple, and making several other stops along the way.</p>
    <p><h3>Day 6 : Western Kyoto</h3></p><p>For this day, you’ll head to the opposite side of Kyoto to Arashiyama and Sagano district. Everyone here visits Tenryuji Temple and the Arashiyama Bamboo Grove. </p>
    <p><h3>Day 7 : Central & Miscellaneous Kyoto</h3></p><p>You’ll still start your day with a couple of shrines and temples, doing a sunrise hike through Fushimi Inari to beat the crowds before enjoying the serenity of Tofukuji’s zen gardens, but this day also includes the Kyoto Railway Museum and Kyoto National Museum, among other things. </p>
    <p><h2>Total Cost : 1,34,800/-</h2></p>
