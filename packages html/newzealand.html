    <h4>Duration : 10 Days, 9 Nigths</h4>     <h4>Temperature : 20°C-24°C</h4>
    <p>New Zealand is often termed as a country of Gods. There is dramatic variation in the terrain of New Zealand. It ranges from geyser to glaciers, from rainforests to meadows. The range in variety in a limited area is the cause for many tourists to opt for New Zealand as tourist destination.</p>
    <p>New Zealand is a country situated in the southern hemisphere close to Australia. New Zealand is basically made up of two islands. One is the North Island and the other South island. There are many smaller islands that are a part of the country. It enjoys a temperate climate due to which there is a variety of flora and fauna. Europeans barring a minority of Maoris mainly inhabit it.</p>
    <h2>ITINERARY : </h2>
    <p><h3>Day 1 : Auckland To Paihia To Auckland</h3></p><p>So during your “jet lag day” perhaps you have seen the City of Sails otherwise known as Auckland, had a wander through New Zealand’s largest city.Now it’s time to hit the road to the fantastical Bay of Islands where beaches are plentiful. Boat tours are one of the best ways to explore the islands of the “Winterless North” and spotting pods of dolphins are not that uncommon! After a day in the bay, make you’re way back to the big city where you can treat yourself to a harbourside dinner or see the city lights from the Sky Tower at night! </p>
    <p><h3>Day 2 : Auckland To Matamata To Rotorua</h3></p><p>For all of you Lord of the Rings fans out there, head down from Auckland to Matamata to experience The Hobbiton Movie Set. Stroll around the Hobbit holes and learn about the behind-the-scenes of one of the most popular movie trilogies of all time. Then end your day in the geothermal hotbed of Rotorua where you can experience an evening Maori cultural show, relax at some mineral hot pools or wander around the town’s free geothermal park, Kuirau Park. Alternatively, for you Hobbit-haters, head straight from Auckland to Rotorua to spend more time exploring the geothermal parks and Maori shows. </p>
    <p><h3>Day 3 : Rotorua To Taupo</h3></p><p>This might be a short journey, but you’re going to want to spend plenty of time in what is considered the adventure capital of the North Island, Taupo. Whatever your buzz, you’re likely to find it here, from skydiving over New Zealand’s largest lake to bungy jumping over the mighty Waikato River. If you fancy something more relaxing, try trout fishing or sailing to the Maori Rock Carvings on the lake or a walk down to the free natural hot pools at Spa Park.  </p>
    <p><h3>Day 4 : Taupo To Napier</h3></p><p>Napier is a town with a fascinating history and a whole lot of wine! Learn how this Art Deco-style city got to have such stand-out architecture by exploring the city. Once that’s done, you have a whole wine region to explore with wine tours leaving from the city and vineyards and wineries to explore by bike. Treat yourself to some famous New Zealand wine and grab a few gifts for the family back home!</p>
    <p><h3>Day 5 : Napier To Wellington</h3></p><p>Heading south on the North Island will eventually bring you to Wellington, New Zealand’s capital city. Your stay can’t go without checking out the highly-regarded Te Papa Museum where you can learn all about the country’s weird and wonderful wildlife, geography and history. The artistic city also has much to discover along its waterfront, as well as in the huge Botanic Garden. By night, hit CourtenayPlace and Cuba Street for a big night out. </p>
    <p><h3>Day 6 : Wellington To Picton To Christchurch</h3></p><p>We recommend an early-morning sailing on the Wellington to Picton ferry to enjoy the sunrise as you enter the stunning Marlborough Sounds. Soak up the scenery of forest-clad mountains that appear to rise from the sea then arrive in Picton where you can start making your way to the South Island’s main hub, Christchurch. The city is often a fascinating subject for anyone interested to see the effects of an earthquake on a city. Tours are available around the city, but you can also take a wander yourself through the Botanic Gardens and check out the Canterbury Museum.</p>
    <p><h3>Day 7 : Christchurch To Mt Cook To Queenstown</h3></p><p>The drive is a thrill in itself as you travel through lands of snow-peaked mountains and brilliant blue lakes. A detour to Mt Cook is well worth it to get closer views of New Zealand’s highest mountain and to explore the glacial lakes of these alpine valleys. Then head southwards to “New Zealand’s Adventure Capital”, Queenstown where you are spoiled for choice with adrenaline activities.</p>
    <p><h3>Day 8 : A Day In Queenstown Or A Trip To Milford Sound</h3></p><p>If adrenaline experiences are your thing, you may want to opt for a full day in Queenstown where you can experience bungy jumping, jet boating, white water rafting, skydiving, skiing, mountain biking and more! For those of you who are all about the awe-inspiring scenery, take a day trip to the famous Milford Sound. The journey into the World Heritage Site of the Fiordland National Park is an experience in itself. Then take a boat cruise through the majestic fiord of Milford Sound!</p>
    <p><h3>Day 9 : Queenstown To Franz Josef To Greymouth</h3></p><p>It’s time to hit the wild West Coast! Travel along roads lines with mountains and native forest to some of the most accessible glaciers in the country. Take a helicopter flight onto the Franz Josef Glacier itself or opt for a free hike to the terminal face. From Franz Josef, continue to Greymouth. For the evening, you may want to have a classic Kiwi pint at the Monteith’s Brewery where you can also do a tour of the brewery itself.</p>
    <p><h3>Day 10 : Greymouth To Christchurch</h3></p><p>What is considered one of the most scenic train journeys in the world, the TranzAlpine between Greymouth and Christchurch is not to be missed. Travel from the rugged forests of the West Coast and into the mountains of Haast Pass. Finally, you’ll go through the Canterbury Plains until you reach Christchurch for your final night in Aotearoa New Zealand. Christchurch Airport is a bustling international airport which is a popular place to leave New Zealand.</p>
