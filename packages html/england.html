    <h4>Duration : 7 Days, 6 Nigths</h4>     <h4>Temperature : 12°C-6°C</h4>
    <p>Built for pleasure and relaxation, beautiful Bath has been a wellbeing destination since Roman times. Bath's extraordinary array of architectural treasures has earned the whole city UNESCO World Heritage Site status. It is home to one of the world's best-preserved Roman bath houses – cited here because of hot springs that bubble up at a toasty 46°C degrees. With its honey-coloured colleges arrayed in splendor beside the river, the university town of Oxford is a seductive vision of medieval learning and modern charm.  One of the world's most visited cities, London has something for everyone: from history and culture to fine food and good times. The city's buildings are striking milestones in a unique and beguiling biography, and a great many of them – the Tower of London, Westminster Abbey, Big Ben – are instantly recognizable landmarks.</p>
    <p>England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Wales to the west and Scotland to the north. The Irish Sea lies west of England and the Celtic Sea to the southwest.</p>
