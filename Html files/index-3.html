						<p>Everyone keeps saying how important it is to travel. So what's all this fuss about? Why do people travel and love travelling?</p><p>Traveling is a humbling experience. It is merely a superior feeling: to go to another country, and to see people live differently, speak differently, look differently. This is how one comes to understand how big and crazy our world is. It’s a great, big world out there with billions and billions of people, who each day live their life and have their own unique experiences.Travelling is a part of our multifaceted life. We explore something new during every trip; we overcome new difficulties and problems. In such a manner, we get out of our comfort zone. Travelling is a lesson of life, it is something like self-discovering.</p> <p>As Nicholas Roerich put it: “Nothing enriches you like a journey”.  One of the significant benefits of traveling is finding and keeping inner balance. Too often, people get wrapped up in their lives, their daily routine of working, sleeping, eating, and living. They become self-absorbed to the point when their fatigue affects their health, their happiness, and their future.</p> <p>The benefits of traveling are not just a one-time thing: traveling changes you physically and psychologically. There is a quote by Mark Twain that I love: “Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn't do than by the ones you did do.” Cliché as this may sound, the money you spend on travel, is an investment in yourself. Travel doesn't make you feel as bad for spending money.</p>

						<p>Away from home, one comes to understand what “home” actually is and what it means.</p> <p>Traveling is the perfect entertainment for a person of any age. On the one hand, it helps people to form a better understanding of themselves, their beliefs, and their lives. On the other, it also provides people with a better understanding of the world they live in, even if it’s beyond their immediate environment. Moreover, it may even help a person to feel connected to the many people living in the world.</p> <p> Nevertheless that their lives may never meet or they are so utterly different that they may as well be from different planets.</p> <p>Perhaps their native country is not as free as they had been told or initially thought it to be, for example. One does not understand what it means to be a citizen of their native country until they have seen it from a distance, from another, completely different country. When traveling elsewhere and having to live according to a foreign place’s laws and social norms, one immediately thinks of how things are done in their own country and culture and begins to favor one way or another. </p> <p> This changes how one feels about their native land, whether in a better or a worse way. This notion can be applied to various characteristics, such as women’s rights, human rights, customs and traditions, beliefs, a trust for government, etc. Traveling is always beneficial for the individual experiencing it.</p>
